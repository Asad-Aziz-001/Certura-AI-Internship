# **Certura-AI-Internship**

ü§ñ Certura AI Internship Projects: Three hands-on AI tasks completed during my internship. 

Includes a Flask chatbot, an image classifier with TensorFlow/MobileNet, and a text summarizer with spaCy.


# **ü§ñ Project 1: Development of a Responsive FAQ Chatbot**

Utilizing Python and the Flask micro-framework, I engineered a conversational chatbot. The core functionality involved creating a intelligent dictionary-based matching system to respond to user queries. I implemented robust logic to handle unrecognized inputs with helpful default responses, simulating a real-world customer support environment. This project solidified my understanding of backend web development and basic conversational AI principles.

# **üñºÔ∏è Project 2: Image Classification with Pre-trained Deep Learning Model**

I leveraged the power of TensorFlow and Keras to implement an image classification system. By integrating the pre-trained MobileNet model‚Äîa sophisticated convolutional neural network designed for efficiency‚ÄîI built a script capable of accurately predicting and classifying images into one of a thousand categories. This involved crucial steps of image preprocessing (resizing, normalization) and interpreting the model's prediction outputs, giving me firsthand experience with transfer learning and deep learning for computer vision.

# **üìÑ Project 3: NLP-Based Text Summarization Tool**

Addressing the challenge of information overload, I developed a text summarization tool using natural language processing techniques with the spaCy library. The project involved tokenizing text, analyzing content, and implementing an extraction-based summarization algorithm to condense large paragraphs into concise, coherent summaries without losing critical meaning. This task provided deep insights into text processing and the fundamentals of NLP.

# **üéØ Key Learnings & Takeaways:**

Applied Technical Skills: Enhanced my expertise in Python, Flask, TensorFlow/Keras, and spaCy.

AI Fundamentals: Gained practical experience in key AI domains: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Conversational AI.

Problem-Solving: Strengthened my ability to troubleshoot, debug, and logically structure code to meet project objectives.

Project Lifecycle: Managed the end-to-end development process for multiple projects, from setup and implementation to testing and deployment.

This internship has been a cornerstone in my professional development, providing me with the confidence and skills to tackle complex AI challenges.

I am grateful to the Certura team for providing this structured and challenging opportunity and for fostering an environment of growth and innovation.
